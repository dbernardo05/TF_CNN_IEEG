# TF_CNN_IEEG
Intracranial EEG (iEEG) Pattern Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow.
These scripts generate Z-normalized spectrograms from iEEG data at time bins T for each channel C in an electrode grid with size width x depth (W x D). 
The spectra are frequency binned into F frequencies to create tensors with dimension (W x D x F) for use with CNN, e.g. AlexNet used here as a toy example.
